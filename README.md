Stratego
========
Stratego is a board game with 2 players where 2 opponents attempt to capture each other's flag. Each player sets up their army's starting locations and then battle each other. We are bringing this game to a java servlet ran website. This is the final project for Computer Science 319 Fall Semester 2014 by Jacob Moyer, Matt Clucas, and Mike Mead.
